                <p>Initially, remote work seemed like a good thing to a lot of people. Employees or at least white-collar knowledge workers had more flexibility in their schedules, could spend more time with their families, and saved money on gas from commuting to work. New areas of research exploded, from contact tracing, to virtual learning, to solutions to prevent future pandemics.</p>
                <p>“The pandemic has sparked large-scale innovation and experimentation for organizations. Technology use … has increased dramatically since the onset of the pandemic due to business demands for higher agility and flexibility. Organizations that had previously resisted the idea of remote work were forced to change to adapt to the new reality and change quickly. Cloud-based technology especially has seen a significant increase.” writes Tim Jacks, senior editor of JGITM in an article titled “Research on Remote Work”</p>
                <p>However, remote work has revealed some serious issues in our economy and society. While white-collar jobs were overall able to transition to virtual work with relative ease, many other jobs across the country saw massive unemployment. This had an especially negative effect on women, with 100% of net jobs lost in December 2020 in the United States being women, many with other intersectional minority identities. (Fortune) “The work environment, especially the remote-work environment, is shifting backwards to become more male-dominated” (Research on Remote Work).</p>
                <p>There are also more subtle changes that are ripple effects from moving to remote work. A lot of our communication is based on body language and shared spaces, things that are lost over video calls. “Water-cooler chit-chat” is gone, as are opportunities for chance encounters with executives or fellow employees that could lead to promotion or new opportunities.</p>
                <p>Group work and communication are a big challenge for newly remote workers. “They're more likely to report slow, inefficient processes and communication, which can hinder operational speed and productivity. These challenges often ladder up to bigger issues that negatively affect workers' sense of belonging and overall work satisfaction,” reads an article from the communication app Slack.</p>
                <p>It's important to keep in mind that not all jobs can be done remotely. Of almost 3,000 employees surveyed, nearly half said that working remotely made their jobs more difficult, and roughly 11% said that they couldn't do their job at all. Employees in fields like health care, research, education, and customer support were more likely to say that they couldn't work from home, while those in management, business development, and IT expressed that it was easier. Reasoning for why remote work was hard were varied, from doctors needing to perform a procedure or needing to count physical inventory, to simply not having the technology or tools to do the job from home, be that specialized programs, machines, or communication.</p>
                <p>As the pandemic state of emergency has lifted, we've seen many jobs return to in-person work. Some of the skills learned during remote work have stuck around, especially the technology. Others have faded to the background as we try to return to “normal.” It is likely that we will continue to see the effects of our period of virtual isolation for years to come.</p>
