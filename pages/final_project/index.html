                <p>The United States officially entered a lockdown quarantine on March 15th, 2020. The mandate forced individuals to their homes, schools to close, and all non-essential work places to shut down or go virtual. This switch to virtual was easier for some than others. Some jobs, especially those that had previously been remote or closely tied to tech, saw an increase in productivity and quickly made plans to keep a virtual work position available permanently. Some others, especially those that revolved around group work and collaboration, saw sinking morale, lack of communication, and social isolation. Others lost their jobs as companies began to cut costs and had to struggle through the struggling economy.</p>
                <p>Around the world, we saw countries closing down in response to the pandemic. Now in 2023 we can look back and see some of the rippling effects of the choices made in that time of crisis. There will undoubtedly be more that become visible as we give more time for them to become clear, but even with three years, there have been plenty of opportunities for research, especially in the field of teaching and education.</p>
                <p>“The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the face of global IT forever and “remote work” is now simply “work”. This has quickly become a cultural norm around the world due to the extensive use of information technologies including cloud computing, video conferencing, collaboration platforms, and broadband Internet.” (Research on Remote Work).</p>
                <p>As the pandemic state of emergency has lifted, we've seen many jobs return to in-person work, across all industries across the country. Some of the skills learned during remote work have stuck around, especially the technology. Others have faded to the background as we try to return to “normal.” It is likely that we will continue to see the effects of our period of virtual isolation for years to come.</p>
