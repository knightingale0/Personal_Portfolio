           <p>Everyone spills out of the car, but I wait. When the shouts grow quieter, I am forced to follow. I try to stay behind, but they push and pull at me and my space until they see a hill ahead. The snow is cold and I sit with my face to the sky in silence. Then a silhouette, a bird? And another and another and a whole flock. I laugh at the calls and when they return we all laugh. Now when they poke I poke back and we talk and laugh and drive home together.</p>
