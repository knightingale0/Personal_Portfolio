            <p>The music starts, the lights come up, and we run to the front of the stage for curtain call. Thundering cheers carry through to the senior's final bows, and I stand to the side with the rest of the ensemble, clapping as hard as any proud parent. </p>
            <p>auditioned for the spring musical in my junior year of high school with low expectations and high hopes. I’d done theater on and off since 4th grade and thought that, with my age and experience, I could easily secure a lead role. I was wrong. After a mediocre audition, my name found itself on the cast list, comfortably resting at the very bottom of the ensemble.</p>
            <p>I tried to let it not get to me, but it was hard seeing my cast mates learn the songs with cool harmonies, and practice lines during lunch, while I sat double-checking if I was even in the scene. </p>
            <p>Covid became a growing concern and nuisance for the show. But for me, it was a great opportunity. Any time someone was out sick, which was unfortunately often, I got to read their lines, act their positions, and sing their parts. A quick study for music, I was encouraged to sit in whenever a group was learning a new song, just in case. Of course, when the full cast was present, I would retreat to the prop table, making sure chalkboards and scarves were distributed to the right people and put away on time. But I felt appreciated and useful, and while it wasn’t a lead part, I felt mostly content. </p>
            <p>A week out from the show, I got a call from the director telling me that one of the leads had just gotten Covid. She needed to know if I could step up and fill that role for opening night, and presumably the shows after that. I told her I’d think about it, and about an hour later I texted her saying I’d try my best. </p>
            <p>That week was chaos, but I treasured every second of it. I had lines, choreography, people who interacted with me on the stage; I felt seen. </p>
            <p>But as one, then another actor fell ill, the show was forced to be delayed until they were all able to perform. I handed the role back to my friend with reluctance, and spent the official shows backstage, pointing to what scene was next and handing out snacks. </p>
            <p>The audience is standing now, and the actors closest to the front tense, ready to greet their family and friends after their huge achievement. The lighting and sound crew are waving too, and the frantic nervous energy send my arm waving in response. The lights come up in the house and flowers are retrieved from purses and under seats.  I fall back, so there is more room at the edge of the stage for hugs and gifts and shouted “Congratulations” and “You were amazing”s. I am handed a small yellow rose by another ensemble member, which I hug close. When I see my friend’s bouquet, there are yellow roses in hers as well.</p>
