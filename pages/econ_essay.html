        <main>
            <p>Thank you for being here today to discuss plans for renovations and changes to this school’s campus. This plan involves construction to the barn, moving classrooms around, a new room for an US lounge, and a larger and more accessible greenhouse, as well as staggering grade levels arrival and departure times further to combat the congestion. </p>
            <p>The largest change would be a major reconstruction project for the barn. This would include adding a basement, fixing the heating and water, and making the second floor significantly more structurally sound. While expensive, the basement would allow for a more central hub of performing arts spaces, with the dance and music rooms from the lower level of Amos being relocated to this added floor. This does pose possible accessibility issues, but as these rooms were already on a lower level in the main building, students would have the same level of difficulty accessing these spaces. Additionally, making the performing arts building a more inviting location could boost student interest in those activities and encourage students to try new activities and meet new people. </p>
            <p>While we are talking about classrooms, this proposition would see several of the Mezzalingua Humanities rooms repurposed for offices, middle school, and lower school, as well as the four upper Amos rooms being designated for lower school. The Bradley rooms currently being used for lower school would become social studies and foreign language classrooms. This would make the walk to the classrooms longer for young students arriving through the Phoenix, so this proposal would also recommend having lower school students arrive through the McNeil lobby instead. </p>
            <p>The art rooms would be moved to the current languages corner, with some reconstruction to allow a more open space for students to work on the multitude of art activities offered. </p>
            <p>Upper school English would be relocated to the Learning Commons rooms across from a reopened and restocked library, with a designated area for academic support and a very open and friendly environment. A major redesign could occur in the hallway space between the gym and the library, with seating and places to display student art, across from a new room for the US lounge, narrowing the entrance to the STEAM park but still leaving plenty of space. </p>
            <p>Additionally in the STEAM park, we would see the construction of a larger and more accessible greenhouse in the back corner of the biology classroom, encouraging students to learn more about the natural world, year round. A small extension on the back of the gym would allow more office and storage space, and repaving the remaining space along the back wall of the school could serve as additional parking space for faculty, staff and students. </p>
            <p>We would also see the redoing of the lower parking space, between the lower field and the tennis courts, increasing the capacity and accessibility by shifting the playground to allow a short lane to turn down that direction. Combined with staggered arrival and dismissal times, this should create less traffic on the main road. </p>
            <p>We see the spaces that are currently the art rooms being used as multipurpose spaces, for meetings, advisories, club meeting places, and even just as a place for students to work, possibly with a selection of books from the library and basic materials in constant supply. Alternatively, these rooms could be designated specifically for middle school, giving them an area of the building to create their own space and have classes not already given space. </p>
            <p>From the floor plan you can also see several places that have been labeled for office spaces, which in combination with the farmhouse offices, classroom spaces, and the spaces on the second floor of the main building, should provide space to all faculty members, while still leaving flexible space if the need arises. </p>
            <p>The staggered times would have upper school waiting until closer to 830 or 9 to start the school day, allowing lower and middle school to arrive with less traffic, and a clear split in who needs to go where, combined with a slightly expanded entrance to allow a truly “bus only” lane. We would carry this stagger to the end of the day, with upper school students having classes or activities until 330 or a bit later. This would require slightly longer teaching days and cut into after school activities, for example sports, but would allow students to sleep in longer, and would greatly ease the arrival and dismissal procedures. </p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to come to this meeting, if you have any questions, the floor is open. </p>
