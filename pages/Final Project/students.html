                <p>The pandemic forced many educational institutions to go virtual, and here we can see how virtual leaning and remote work affect small teams. A survey of college students working on long-term group projects that had been forced to go virtual by the pandemic revealed some of the challenges that the students were facing.</p>
                <p>Not unexpectedly, many team members reported a variety of challenges that came about during the pandemic that made it difficult to engage in effective teamwork. Some of the struggles of this new form of collaboration came from external factors. For example, working from home caused distractions and stress for some of the students. Stress and workload from other classes also affected students' ability to work on the project (pmc).</p>
                <p>Participants also mentioned two other types of challenges. The first is geographical differences, where students' locations had an effect on the times students could work, what methods they used to communicate, and the timeline for the project. This is a problem that really affects teams much more than individuals. The second challenge was team member performance issues. Teams saw increased procrastination, forgetfulness, and distraction. Performance issues like forgetfulness are not unique to teams. However, other research emphasizes that issues caused by suddenly changing to working remotely impact all team members, which will have an impact on the team's ability to achieve shared goals.</p>
                <p>Regarding communication, teams reported everything from extremely negative to extremely positive changes. Some teams, especially if they were already using virtual communication modes prior to the pandemic, mentioned that not much had changed for them in terms of communication. Another team had been relying on texting from the start: “However our communication has not changed, we never really talked in class and just texted which is what we still use” (pmc). This example is interesting because it shows that even if teams are able to have face-to-face communication and collaboration, they can choose to work virtually anyway.</p>
                <p>Some other changes included task changes and role changes. Task changes reflected how groups no longer had access to some parts of their projects, and so had to find alternative ways to finish the project using virtual tools. This is a problem that has a bigger impact on teams than individual projects. If an individual was working on a project, they could still work on that project in isolation, but a collaborative project worked on by a team makes that option much less safe. Role changes occurred when a team member's fundamental role changed from one to task or aspect of the project to another. This seemed to happen for two reasons; either the whole project changed, and naturally the group had to adjust who did what for the new project, or team members picked up jobs that made more sense for their location, technology, and time availability.</p>
                <p>Teams also reported struggling with morale and direction with the projects. As competitions were canceled, resources became harder to access, and isolation set in, students had a hard time focusing on their tasks, in part because they didn't know what the project was even for anymore.</p>
                <p>As the pandemic state of emergency has lifted, we've seen many groups return to in-person work. Some of the skills learned during remote learning have stuck around, especially the technology. Others have faded to the background as we try to return to “normal.” It is likely that we will continue to see the effects of our period of virtual isolation for years to come.</p>
