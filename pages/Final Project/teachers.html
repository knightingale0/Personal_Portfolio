                <p>Teaching has been hugely affected by the pandemic and the switch to virtual learning. While higher education like Universities have been able to handle the switch for their lecture style classes, primary and secondary education have faced a lot of challenges. Teachers that rely on face-to-face connections and communication with their students, especially those in middle and elementary schools, have had to adapt their entire curriculum to a virtual classroom, taking more time for smaller results.</p>
                <p>Surveys both in the United States and in other countries show similar results. Teachers are overworked, underpaid, and stressed. Especially in primary and secondary education, where the majority of teachers are women, the line between work and life is blurred. Teachers with children of their own expressed that there was no support for them, despite being expected to teach up to 30 kids while having their own under the same roof, often in the same room. Teachers were also universally concerned about the wellbeing of their students. “Some 80 percent believed students would need extra instructional support when they got back to school” reads a report on teachers in Australia and New Zealand. The social isolation was also a real threat on their minds, especially for younger students, who need face-to-face connection for development.</p>
                
                <p>Teaching virtually caused a lot of issues for teachers. Trying to adapt existing material to a new format or even having to write whole new curricula takes time and trial and error. Some programs simply can't be transferred, like many engineering programs or any other hands-on, group-work-based classes. Combined with having to learn new technology, often up to five new programs, most survey respondents reported working at least 10 more hours a week or more. Many teachers also use the time at school to talk to colleagues and friends, another thing lost to virtual learning. For teachers that live on their own, virtual learning was a very isolating experience. Several survey respondents also reflected on how they feel they teach better and can solve problems more effectively when they have easy collaboration with their colleagues, which exacerbated the difficulties of teaching virtually.</p>
                <p>As the pandemic state of emergency has lifted, we've seen many schools return to in-person learning. Some of the skills learned during remote learning have stuck around, especially the technology. Others have faded to the background as we try to return to “normal.” It is likely that we will continue to see the effects of our period of virtual isolation for years to come.</p>
