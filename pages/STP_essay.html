            <h2>STP Essay - So You Want To Tell A Story</h2>
            <p>What is your favorite story? Chances are, you just pictured a book in your mind, maybe a recent read or maybe something from your childhood. I grew up reading stories in books, but stories are all around us. Movies, TV shows, magazines, even advertisements often have a story to them. Humans have told stories for as long as we have been able to communicate. From paintings and shadows, to spoken word and written language, we want to share our ideas and creativity with the people around us and the world at large. And one of the most underrated and overlooked mediums of storytelling–not to mention one that I adore–is video games. </p>
            <p>Games tell stories. They kind of have to. One of the biggest genres of games is RPGs or Role Playing Games, though this name is misleading. Almost every game is a Role Playing Game in some shape or form, because you, the human playing the game, are not represented exactly as you are. There are of course games in the Simulator genre that try to mimic this; the game might be of a human person sitting at a desk looking at a computer. An example of this is the Stanley Parable, where you control an office worker as the narrator tries to guide you through a predetermined narrative. But you are not Stanley. He still isn’t you exactly as you are, and in that way the title of RPG can be too broad.</p>
            <p>All this is to say that games have a narrative, and therefore a story.</p>
            <p>I have been writing stories since Kindergarten, and while much has changed about them, from the plots, characters, writing style, length, and even medium, they are still stories. In this project I wanted to take my love of stories, of writing, of designing a world, of creating a place in my imagination and making it so others can see it too, and combine it with my love of games. Thanks to a summer internship making visual novels, a digital, illustrated chose-your-own-adventure style game, I knew some very basic programming. And I had hundreds of hours of experience playing games, old and new. I thought I knew what I was doing. How hard could it be?</p>

            <h3>Some Background</h3>
            <p>Games are a lasting element of early humanity. Since as early as 5000 years ago, 3000 BCE, humans have spent their time playing social games. These were used to teach cooperation, military strategy, and competition. "Senet was a game placed in Ancient Egypt in 3100 BC, and the earliest set of dice… was found in a Backgammon set." (Orsini). Chess, Checkers, Mancala, and Go, too, are board games with roots tracing far back in our history.  As we evolved as a species, our games evolved too, modifying and adjusting to new technologies, new cultural needs, and adapting as cultures intersected and shared their ideas with others, expanding both groups’ ideas as a result.</p>
            <p>"In October 1958, Physicist William Higinbotham created what is thought to be the first video game." (Tretkoff) It was a simple tennis game, called, fittingly, Tennis For Two. Initially designed as an exhibit to show off the instrumentation division’s work, it grew quickly in popularity among the staff and visitors. After a few design iterations, it was replaced with a different display, and Tennis For Two faded into the background. However, the concept had been realized, and soon other games like Pong came onto the scene, becoming more widely known. With less code and fewer circuits, Pong was much easier to reproduce and play on a variety of devices, initially in arcade cabinets and later on home consoles.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As computer technology advanced, games were able to get more complex while still being able to run in arcades, displays, home entertainment systems, and computers. Games’ stories stayed fairly simple; sports games, like Pong, "shoot ’em ups," where the goal is to survive as long as possible in one uninterrupted session against waves of enemies, like Space Invaders, and others. The now-classic Pac-Man was one of the first games where there was some effort put into a story. From Keith Stuart, "The ghosts are called Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde and they each have their own personalities based on AI routines." ("The game that ate the world"). Deliberately naming characters and giving them personality was a new idea. Pac-Man’s success heralded a boom in merchandise for video games. "In the early 1980s, "Pac-Man Fever" was a genuine phenomenon" (Tronek). Referring to the cultural obsession with Pac-Man, Buckner & Garcia released a song "Pac‐Man Fever" in 1982 about the game. Pac-Man was also the first game to have a TV series made about it. "The Pac-Man cartoon was put out by Hanna-Barbara and aired on ABC. It was based on the successful Pac-Man game, came out in 1982 and ran for 44 episodes." (Everything 80s Podcast). Whether intentionally or not, Pac-Man set a precedent that popular games could become more than just games. They could spin off and inspire more stories, which could in turn inspire even more.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As even more technology emerged, more options became available, and the industry saw the beginning of text based story games. Colossal Cave Adventure was released by Will Crowther in 1976. In it, the player’s computer would describe the room or situation to the player, who would then type in what they wanted to do. It was an incredible evolution of gameplay, but there were some drawbacks. "Most of the player’s time was spent arguing with the computer." wrote Sid Meier in his book Sid Meier’s MEMOIR! (p.69). Because the game was programmed to accept certain commands, a spelling error or difference in grammar would cause the computer to not recognize the player’s intent. However, these text games formed a framework for a future of games about player interactions with a story. First those interactions came through text commands, then keyboard inputs for movement, mouse clicks, and now with our bodies through VR. </p>
            <p>Considering that we have only had this medium for 50 years, the sheer number of products is astounding. There are huge libraries of games now available to the public through online shops like itch.io and Steam. With so many things to look at, labels were created to show customers what they could look for. One of the most useful categories for customers is the genre, or what kind of game they want to play. Are they looking for a high energy first-person shooter, a brain twisting puzzle, an open world sandbox where they can create whatever experience they want? Video games fill hundreds of genres with thousands of subgroups. Any story or color scheme or mechanic has probably been used somewhere. To stand out in the market you need to take an existing thing, be that genre, story, mechanic, and add something to it. You have to give your players something familiar and add a new twist, a way of interacting with the world, something unique to your game and experience. Break the mold.</p>

            <h3>Use of the medium</h3>
            <p>"NIGHT IN THE WOODS is an adventure game focused on exploration, story, and character, featuring dozens of characters to meet and lots to do across a lush, vibrant world." (Infinite Fall.) reads the marketing definition from the official Night In The Woods site. The story follows Mae, a college dropout who has returned to her hometown of Possum Springs. The town is dying due to the world advancing without it, and she struggles with the realization that her old community has moved on without her, and in fact most of the people there saw her leaving as a good thing. The game deals heavily in topics of death, belonging, personal identity, mental health, and other ideas of existentialism.</p>
            <p><em>Night In The Woods</em> is a standout among any genre you try to put it in. If you call it a story game, there is an interesting use of the player’s access to choice. If you call it a platformer game, there is a fascinating use of direction and movement to accentuate the narrative. If you call it horror, the art style, music, and mostly happy ending might beg to differ.</p>
            <p>The format of a game for this particular story lends itself incredibly well to the themes it tackles. For example, there is a tendency in western media to assume that things moving to the right is progress, moving towards the future. This might be because most western languages write from left to right, or because of how we structure time measuring devices like timelines, or in some of the first big games like the Super Mario franchise. Whatever the reason, we associate rightward movement with moving forward. Night In The Woods uses this in a very clever way in that the first scene of the game, and a large majority of the scenes after, force the character to move to the left. Away from the future, back to a past that we want to return to. Even if that past can’t exist.</p>
            <p>The game also deals with the idea of choices. What choices are we able to make? What choices are made for us? How do we make those choices knowing how they will affect others? Night In The Woods features a moderate cast of non-player characters, or NPCs, to interact with, all very realistic and well written, and some of the biggest choices come from interactions with those characters. Three in particular, Mae’s childhood best friends, Greg, Angus, and Bea, pose a choice roughly halfway through the game: the option to spend quality time with one of them. However, while the choices you make may influence your understanding of the characters and the bond you form with them, they ultimately have a very small impact on the story.</p>
            <p>Unlike other choice-driven story games like Life is Strange or Detroit: Become Human, where your decisions can send you off on branching trees of story threads, Night In The Woods will present you with dialogue choices that are often not even choices. There is often a paradoxical nature to these moments; for example in a scene where you are talking to Bea, she makes a comment about how the people in town are trapped with no way forward. A dialogue choice option appears above Mae’s head, with two options: "You always have a choice," and "You can always choose." In this situation, in a conversation about choices, you, as the player and as Mae, have no choice.</p>
            <p>These interactions and choices are only possible in the format of interactive media, like video games. There are countless other examples of why the story format works so well for Night In The Woods. For instance there is a scene where we as the player finally learn why Mae left for college and why the town’s people are hesitant around her. While lying on a couch with one of her old friends, Mae explains that she had a dissociative episode.</p>

            <p id="inGameQuote">"It was all just pixels. The characters on screen, I felt like I knew them. They weren't people anymore, they were just shapes. And their lines were just things someone had written, they never existed. They never had feelings. They never would exist either. And it felt so sad. Like I just lost these real people. And this whole thing we had, it was just me, alone. And like that realization like dumped out of the screen and into real life. Went outside and the tree out front, I looked at it every day, it was like a friend outside the window. Now it was just a thing... just a thing that was there, growing and eating and just being there. Like all the stuff I felt about the tree was just in my head. And there was some guy walking by, and he was just shapes. Just like this moving bulk of stuff. And I cried, because nothing was there for me anymore. It was all just stuff. Stuff in the universe. Just... dead."</p>

            <p>In any story this would be an incredible representation of deteriorating mental health and a feeling of being out of place, but in a game it is almost fourth wall breaking. The game has a very geometric, paper-art style. When Mae begins to describe how she saw the world as shapes, you as the player can’t help but make a connection between what she is saying and the style of the media that is telling it to you.</p>
            <p>The game's tagline is "At the end of everything, hold on to anything." and that is very fitting for the story it tells. The narrative explores the idea of endings: both the personal feelings of your world ending even though you are trying so hard to hold onto it, and the bizarre reality of members of a cult in the town sacrificing members of the community in the hopes that it will somehow revitalize the town back to the glory days, (which, granted, is a less relatable narrative but still an interesting one to explore.) And of course because nothing can last forever, the game, too must end. It ends with Mae holding to anything she can, namely her parents and her friends, moving to the right across the screen, towards a future.</p>

            <h3>The myth of "good"</h3>
            <p>There is no perfect way to make a “good” game, because “good” is a very subjective rating. A puzzle game might be an intriguing challenge for some, and for others it may be a source of endless frustration, and it certainly wouldn’t be a “good game” to someone who expected and wanted to play a combat focused first-person shooter game. There are award ceremonies like the Game Awards and Game Developer's Choice Awards, that give out awards similarly to the Oscars or Grammys in categories such as best art, music, story, or for the most innovative games with the restrictions they were created under. But there is no solid way to say a game is objectively “good” any more than you can say that a book is definitively “good” or “bad.”</p>
            <p>When I set out to make a video game, I decided against striving for the impossibility of making an objectively “good” game. I instead decided to take a philosophy that many creators share, and create something that I wanted to play. While researching for this project, nearly every source I looked at said the same thing: if you enjoy what you are making and keep that vision through the entire process, you will find an audience who can see that. They will love the game just as much as you enjoyed making it. This of course leads to a question, “What is my game going to be?”</p>

            <p>A late-night brainstorming session led me to three main ideas for a game I could make, all in different genres and with different stories, each requiring a different style and engine. The first was a horror first-person visual novel set in an abandoned space station. The player would control a character through choosing options at certain points in the story, similarly to a choose-your-own-adventure book. The second was a resource management game in a fantasy setting. Mechanics of resource management are common in strategy games, like Sid Meier's Civilization series or Farthest Frontier. The third was an RPG style collection game with hints at a larger story. While all of these interested me, I chose the last, partially as a challenge and partially because I had recently been playing a lot of top-down RPG collection games, like Undertale, OneShot and some of the older Legend of Zelda games, and so had a wealth of references to pull from to build a product I could be proud of.</p>
            <p>I created a survey that I posted on the internet, with over one hundred respondents. Questions like “What is most important in a game for you?,” “What game(s) do you play the most often and why?,” and “What is a game you dislike and why?,” allowed me to gauge a wide sampling of individuals with a variety of interests and experiences. From the responses I was able to pick a few traits I wanted my game to have. I wanted the player to be able to explore the world. I wanted to have strong world building. And I wanted to maintain some consistency with the art and music.</p>

            <h3>High hopes</h3>
            <p>With all this in mind, I found a game making engine, GameMaker Studio, which I selected because of its pixel art basis, low entry code requirement, and price tag of $0.00. While there are a lot of options for making games, (Unity being a very popular choice for games due to its extensive library of preexisting assets and ability to make 2-D or 3-D games), I decided simplicity was going to be my friend for this project. The other benefit I quickly discovered of choosing GameMaker rather than its competitors, was a video series that detailed instructions for making a top-down RPG style game, in GameMaker. The series was geared towards people who had never used the program before. It was perfect. This video series, “How to Make an RPG from Scratch in GameMaker Studio 2” by Peyton Burnham, combined with my limited knowledge of Python programming, shaped the process of the creation of this game. Initially an over saturated, high resolution speed walking simulator, it has become, well, whatever you choose to describe the final product as.</p>
            <p>My dream for this project was, in my naive mind, achievable. I hoped to create a collection-based educational game set in a forest in autumn, based heavily on my own experiences living in Central New York and taking hikes at places like Beaver Lake, Green Lakes, or Clark’s Reservation. I wanted to showcase the diversity and abundance of wildlife and plants in the area, while simultaneously shining a light on how our natural spaces are being taken over and destroyed by our society’s constant need for progress. I dreamed of having a way for players to interact with the plants, animals, fungi, and other natural features in the game and have a modified inventory system, appearing as a weathered nature journal.</p>
            <p>Having played games like Night in the Woods, I imagined that the journal could double as a way to tell a narrative about the character the player pilots, with notes and doodles in the margins, relating to memories this character could have of similar hikes. I wanted to have interactions with NPCs that would flesh out the world that this story took place in, each with their own views and experiences, that they could share with the player character.</p>
            <p>Sitting on my couch with a pencil and paper, it felt like I could make anything. With a little time and an instructional video when a challenge arose, I truly believed that I could realize all of my dreams in a few months…</p>

            <h3>And harsh realities</h3>
            <p>… Sitting in front of my computer for the third night in a row, half the screen on a step-by-step guide video and the other a multi-tabbed mess of object code and pixel art, I was forced to accept that certain ideas were going to have to be shelved. This was not a startling realization; Stardew Valley was another game I had played recently, made by a solo developer, Eric Barone. It is a calming farming simulator in a pixel art style, and took the creator, who initially intended the project to be done in a few months, over four years. This was in part because he wanted to add more features and only release the game once he felt it was ready. But it was also because he was the only one working on this project, making the story, art, music, code, and any other aspects that he wanted to add.</p>
            <p>Realizing that balancing other school work, an after school job, play rehearsals, and family time was a bigger challenge than I had thought, I decided to create a bare-bones collection system that I could call a final product. Of course if I had a breakthrough that resulted in more time, I could try adding back some of the details that had fleshed out my dream creation, but I set my sights on a more reasonable goal, for now. After weeks though, I began to realize that my combination of poor time management skills and stubborn pride was causing even this smaller goal to seem impossible. I sat down and made a few lists.</p>
            <p>One, the details of my dream game. 
                Two, what I had done so far. 
                Three, what small tasks I thought I could sit down and do in fifteen minute slots. 
                Four, what I was dreading about the project to the point that opening the software seemed impossible.
                </p>
            <p>These lists helped me structure my time more efficiently. I realized that the art of the game was bothering me, with the over saturated colors and flat textures. I didn’t feel motivated to work on a project that looked nothing like how it did in my head. Thankfully, this was a quick fix problem. I forced myself to edit one sprite, the art for any piece of the game, after school each day for a week, and by the time Saturday rolled around, the pixel art skills I’d started the project with had developed into something I was proud of. It still wasn’t perfect, but I set it aside for now, to finally focus on the code.</p>

            <h3>The long winter</h3>
            <p>There’s a term in the video game community, called “Development Hell.” It refers to when a game, often one highly anticipated by fans, takes much longer to release than hoped or intended. While my game, which I temporarily named “Wanting Foliage,” did not have a desperate fan base or a highly anticipated release, I did have a deadline, and the process of inching towards that deadline did feel like my own personal hell. Inexperience combined with tired eyes left me with errors that seemed insurmountable, when in reality it was a very quick fix of a few lines. I had enjoyed making some music and finding sound effects and even the art. However, the endless scroll of copy and pasting code to ensure that the player can interact with the bush no matter which side of the bush they are on, became a slog that was punctuated only by skipping ad breaks on my podcast and running upstairs to refill my water.</p>
            <p>Of course there were some breakthroughs. The moment when I realized that the 15 lines of code on every object in the game could be replaced with a single line in the “create” step of a parent object, a base chunk of code applied to any of its “children”, was both a relief and a slap across the face. There was a breath of “Oh, this is less stressful now,” followed by the self depreciation of “Why did it take me this long to notice that there was a more efficient way to do this?” I gradually learned to just focus on the positive calmness.</p>
            <p>Game Maker Studio is a great engine for game creation. However, it does have one big drawback for me, as someone who initially started coding in software called Ren’Py. Ren’Py was designed for text based stories, and had a built-in text engine that made adding dialogue and any other text incredibly easy. I didn’t realize how rare that was until I tried to create a simple phrase for when the player finds items. This was an issued I’d encountered early into development, but I’d dismissed it as my lack of understanding with how the program worked. I assumed that after a bit of guidance, it would be an easy addition to the project.</p>
            <p>I was wrong.</p>
            <p>Trying to create my own point tally for a hugely simplified version of my original goal has still not happened. The first issue I ran into was with objects reappearing after they had been collected. If the player walked into another screen and back, all the objects in the room would search through their code. They would find that they were supposed to draw themselves onto the screen, and do so. I did not realize this was how their code functioned. While this method was infinitely more efficient than saving data for every room in the whole game file, I had never had to code this kind of thing before. I had assumed that screens would enter a kind of stasis, saving all objects and assets as they were when the player exited the space. This was not the case, as I discovered after a few painful hours of scouring forums and instructional guides.</p>
            <p>But as with almost every other challenge I’d faced during this process, I finally found a YouTube video with less than a thousand views that detailed my exact problem. It gave two solutions: one more complex, involving grid arrays and several other words that I still don’t fully understand the meaning of, and a simpler one that only added a few seconds effort for each object. After implementing the second option, I was able to continue my seemingly eternal struggle with the text and invisible counters.</p>

            <h3>A few takeaways</h3>
            <p>Starting this project, I expected to learn a few things. I assumed that I would grow my coding and pixel art skills, which did happen, both more than I could have hoped. I thought that I would learn a bit of basic audio editing, which did not happen, or at least not any more than what I already knew how to do. In a similar vein I expected to get better at time management, as the amount of time that was needed to truly invest in this creative process was bigger than I could’ve imagined. However, while I do think I started to notice some of my largest shortcomings, I am still hesitant to say that I have good time management skills. They are something that I am going to end up spending the rest of my life learning.</p>
            <p>I did not expect that this project would test my ability to let go of ideas I was initially passionate about, or increase my typing skills, but both of those did happen. When you write the same lines of code twenty times, you develop a stronger muscle memory for where the letters are on the keyboard. And while I had had some experience “killing your babies” or scrapping early ideas that I had grown attached to, this project forced me to practice rethinking ideas under a new set of conditions to make them achievable.</p>
            <p>I still think that this story can be told in an engaging and entertaining way through a video game. Maybe I am not going to be the person who brings this story into a completed form, but working on it taught me some valuable skills, and I enjoyed it for the most part. Part of the goal of this game was to be educational, and that is probably the main reason I feel that a game lends itself to the story. You can read a text book or a nature guide or any other amount of literature and media that is there to only give you facts, but facts wrapped in stories are remembered best. “The power to remember is best illustrated by the fact that grandfather tales have evolved over time, proof of the fact that the mind remembers best in such story forms.” (Raines). Nearly all of my knowledge of the ocean and other aquatic life comes from Netflix documentaries and a Wii game, Fishing Resort. In the game you play as a person on an island, helping to rebuild an aquarium with new exhibits and traveling to a variety of locations to catch hundreds of kinds of fish. Presenting a hopefully relatable scene with a light story fleshing out an educational baseline sounds to me like a great way to get kids, or anyone, to learn the material in that educational baseline.</p>
            <p>This project has decidedly changed my understanding of games. For most of my life they have been something I take for granted. Long development times were only an inconvenience that slowed down my ability to play something I was looking forward too. Now I realize that a lot more goes into game creation, especially behind the scenes. Watching videos by ThatGuyGlen on YouTube, explaining how various popular games were made was a big step in this; seeing how development teams started, what their process was like, and how they ended the project was both inspiring and reassuring for me as someone trying to be a solo developer while balancing school, family, and extracurriculars.</p>
            <p>If I were to do this project again I think I would have to give myself more time, and start using multiple monitors sooner. One of the big hurdles for me in the beginning of the project was trying to do all my work on my moderate sized laptop screen. Unfortunately, as the program I was using had large borders, I only had a roughly 30 square inch space that I could actually code and do art when I was using my whole screen. If I needed to have a forum or guide pulled up on half my screen, that area also halved. Thankfully I was able to start using a multi-monitor setup for the last two months, which increased my productivity and speed because I could finally see what I was doing at a scale that let me see how things interacted.</p>
            <p>My other biggest stumbling block was my time management and concentration. While there were times when I would sit down with a goal and zone back in a few hours later with a functioning part of the game or a whole new set of art assets, most days I spent doing nothing. I would argue with myself whether going down and setting up my computer was worth it for longer than what I spent actually making progress. This executive dysfunction and procrastination combination meant that both the game and my other schoolwork suffered for a few months. While I am not naive enough to say that I have overcome this struggle fully and forever, I believe that I made progress identifying my struggles and a few ways to handle them.</p>
            <p>I set out to make a video game. Something I was passionate about, something that I thought I understood, something that I thought I could sit down and casually complete before December. The reality was hours of watching videos, evenings staring at code, dragging objects into game level rooms, googling hex codes and sound effects, and the struggle and realization that this was a bigger undertaking than I had expected. I learned to modify my expectations when I sabotaged my own schedule. I had to manage my expectation for the quality of a final product and finally realize that there was not going to be a final product in time for publicly sharing it. I forced myself to sit down for just twenty minutes and add something, anything, even if it was bad, because just like with regular writing, is it easier to edit something and make it better than to come up with something perfect from scratch.</p>
            <p>I learned a lot about myself through this project. I am someone who needs short, clear deadlines to be productive. I focus better with music and water on hand. I care possibly too much about how things look and try to make them match the image in my head, even if it’s impossible. But I can make compromises. If I am passionate about something I will try to put everything into it in very uneven bursts of productivity. I like going on walks in nature and taking pictures of the foliage. And I want to tell stories. I want to engage people with a narrative and a purpose and an escape in the way that stories have for my whole life. I want to take the words and ideas in my head and share them with the world, whatever medium that involves, however long it takes. Stories are everywhere, in everyone. You just need to listen.</p>
