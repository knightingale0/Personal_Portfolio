                <section id="introA">
                    <p>As in many other communities of the early nineteenth century, Liverpool had its first cemetery in the heart of the Village. 
                        The graves encircled the Union building which served as both church and school. 
                        Revolutionary veterans were buried there only to be disinterred later and reburied 
                        in the Village cemetery on Tulip Street.</p>

                <section id="intro">
                    <p>Plots in the original section of the cemetery were given to residents as a gift. There are no plots available in the older section of the cemetery.</p>
                    <p>The Village Board of Trustees opened the perimeter of the cemetery on 5th Street, 6th Street and Alder Street for the sale of cemetery plots in 2000. There were 283 plots for sale at that time. There are no longer plots available for purchase.</p>
                    <p>The Village Clerk's office maintains a listing of all burials. A great deal of family history information (obituaries, etc.) is available at the <a href="village-history.html">historian's office</a>. If you need further assistance, please call the <a href="village-clerk.html">Village Clerk's</a> office at <a href="tel:+1315-457-3441">315-457-3441</a>. Another interesting website to search is <a href="https://findagrave.com">Find A Grave</a>. Here you can search for burials all over the world including celebrities and other notable people as well as your own relatives.</p>

                <section id="rules">
                    <h2>General Rules for the Cemetery</h2>
                    <p>All lots are held in accordance with provisions of &sect;1501 of the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law of the State of New York, and of all acts amending the same.</p>
                    <p>The Village of Liverpool Board of Trustees reserves the right to remove, after due notice to the lot owner, any embellishment, effigy, or inscription on a grave which, in the opinion of the majority of the Board, is unsightly or dangerous.</p>
                    <p>Heavy trucking or other vehicular traffic shall be refused entrance to the cemetery, when in the opinion of the Superintendent of Public Works, impairment to the roads and driveways may result.</p>
                    <p>All persons shall be allowed access to the cemetery during daylight hours, observing the rules which are in effect and the propriety due the cemetery.</p>
                    <p>No lot owner shall allow an interment to be made upon their lot except by direct arrangement with the Village of Liverpool. No transfer or assignment of any lot or interest therein will be valid without the consent in writing from the Village of Liverpool. No disinterment or removal from a vault will be allowed without permission from the Village.</p>
                    <p>Wooden benches and wooden or artificial markers are strictly forbidden.</p>
                    <p>All work done in the cemetery shall be done by cemetery employees under the control of the Superintendent of Public Works.</p>
                    <p>No dogs are allowed in the cemetery (on or off leash).</p>
                    <p>All terrain vehicles are prohibited.</p>

                </section>

                <section id="lots">
                    <h2>Lots</h2>
                    <p>The full purchase price must be paid before a deed will be given or a burial allowed on any lot.</p>
                    <p>No enclosure of lots will be allowed but simple corner posts of cut stone may be placed to designate corners or angles of any lot. The corner posts are not to project above the surface of the ground.</p>
                    <p>The price of all lots includes an amount for permanent maintenance. A portion of the price of each lot is set aside by the Village of Liverpool in a Cemetery Fund for permanent maintenance. The income from this fund will be used first for keeping lots properly graded, seeded, and mowed; and secondly for the general improvement and beautification of the cemetery grounds.</p>
                    <p>This fund does not provide for the special care of headstones, monuments, trees, shrubs and flowers nor for the watering of grass and flowers. Information may be obtained from the Superintendent of Public Works regarding the cost of any special work.</p>
                    <p>No sale, transfer, or assignment of any lot or part of any lot will be valid without written consent of the Village Board of Trustees. The record of such a sale or transfer must be made in the records of the cemetery. No person will be recognized as the owner or part owner of a lot unless his of her name appears upon the records of the cemetery as such owner or owners. The joint ownership of lots is not recommended, but where such ownership is deemed necessary it is advised that an agreement be made between the joint owners as to the portion of the lot so owned and the use to be made of it by each party.</p>
                    <p>Upon the death of a lot owner, heirs or devisees should record in the office of the cemetery the name of the person whom they designate to act as the lot owner. If this is not done, the cemetery will designate one of their number, as provided by law.</p>
